ðŸŒ€ Simple Interpreter
A lightweight interpreter built from scratch using Java. It parses and executes a minimal custom language that supports:

Variable declarations (let a = 10)

Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

Expressions with variables and number literals

Print statements (print(a))

ðŸ§  How it works:

Lexing â€“ Converts raw code into tokens

Parsing â€“ Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

Interpreting â€“ Evaluates the AST and executes the code

This is a fun and educational project inspired by how real-world programming languages are built.

ðŸ”§ Features

Custom syntax

Expression evaluation

Variable mapping

ðŸ“¦ Example Code

let a = 10

let b = 5

let c = a + b - 2

print(c)


Output:

13

ðŸš§ Coming Soon

Support for operator precedence (currently left-to-right)
